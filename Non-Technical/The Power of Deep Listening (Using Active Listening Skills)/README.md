Listening is thought of as a soft skill. Perhaps the softest of the soft skills. What’s the big deal you might ask? We listen every day. It’s something we learned to do as children and it comes naturally.

There is a lot going on during communication. The speaker has to put into words not just information but often complex perceptions, thoughts, feelings, and intent. Then a listener has to decode this message through a filter of their own biases, attitudes, beliefs, feelings, motives, and life experiences. And to make it all the more complex, experts tell us that words make up only about 11% of the message in face to face communication. Tone of voice is about 35% of the message and body language as well as other contextual cues make up about 55%. There is simply a lot going on which can make listening so challenging.

Active listening is as suspending judgment and being fully present with another person to understand his or her experience or point of view. Deep listening involves hearing more than the words of the speaker but taps into the deeper meaning, unspoken needs, and feelings conveyed. It is something that is done with the heart as well as the mind.

As you use active listening, you create a climate of respect based on non-judgment and receptivity that allows others to express themselves fully. You make it safe for them to express not only surface opinions but also their deeper feelings and needs as well as inner experience and wisdom.

### Using Active Listening Skills is how you:

· Establish Deeper Connections
· Build Trust, Rapport, and Goodwill
· Bridge Understanding and Foster Unity of Vision and Purpose
· Overcome Friction and Conflict
· Promote Learning, Growth, and Healing
· Unleash Motivation
· Empower others to take Responsibility
· Acquire Vital Information that makes you better at Decision Making and Problem Solving

Have you ever spoken to someone who was fully engaged and interested? Who made you feel you were the only person in the world at that moment? That is the power of using active listening skills. It begins with recognizing that everyone with whom you interact wants to heard and understood. It is your willingness to offer them this gift. The ability to listen is the heart and essence of every healthy relationship. The best and most trusted leaders, bosses, co-workers, spouses/partners, parents, helping professionals, friends, customer service reps, grocery clerks, etc. know how to listen. There are few more valuable gifts you can give the people in your life than that of a willingness and ability to listen deeply by using active listening skills.

### Unfortunately, most of us are not Good Listeners because we tend to:

· Get distracted by random thoughts or what’s going on around us.
· Interpret what others say through our own filters (biases, feelings, motives, experiences).
· Tune out because we think we already know what someone is going to say.
· Think that what others have to say isn’t important.
· Focus on formulating our response rather than hearing them out.
· Quickly judge (agree or disagree) rather than opening ourselves to another’s point of view.
· Wait impatiently for someone to finish so we can talk.
· Shut down messages we don’t want to hear.
· Hear the words only and not the deeper needs or meaning conveyed.
· Take over the conversation by our comments and questions.
· Offer solutions and “quick fixes” rather than guiding others to their own wisdom and experience.
· Try to make others feel better rather than letting them own and work through their experience.

Presenting an exercise and case-study in which we look at common ways people respond, even when our intentions are good and we want to help and support people. This section is becoming aware of what we do that is not helpful. We have to recognize old patterns that are not helpful before we’re ready to learn new, healthier responses.

> Section Four:

Putting active listening in context to show you when and how to transition to other skills, particularly once you’ve done a good job of listening. In particular, focusing on a skill called valuing which is helping people solve their own problems without taking over for them.

Finally, is the conclusion in which summarizing the program, what you have learned and offer parting thoughts. You’ll also have a chance to take the survey again and see how much you’ve improved in your active listening skills.
