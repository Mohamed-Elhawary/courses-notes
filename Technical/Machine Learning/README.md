Machine learning (ML) powers some of the most important technologies we use, from translation apps to autonomous vehicles. This course explains the core concepts behind ML.

ML offers a new way to solve problems, answer complex questions, and create new content. ML can predict the weather, estimate travel times, recommend songs, auto-complete sentences, summarize articles, and generate never-seen-before images.

In basic terms, ML is the process of training a piece of software, called a model, to make useful predictions or generate content from data.

### Course Format

> Linear Regression: 

An introduction to linear regression, covering linear models, loss, gradient descent, and hyperparameter tuning.

> Logistic Regression: 

An introduction to logistic regression, where ML models are designed to predict the probability of a given outcome.

> Classification:

An introduction to binary classification models, covering thresholding, confusion matrices, and metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC.

> Working with Numerical Data:

Learn how to analyze and transform numerical data to help train ML models more effectively.

> Working with Categorical Data:

Learn the fundamentals of working with categorical data: how to distinguish categorical data from numerical data; how to represent categorical data numerically using one-hot encoding, feature hashing, and mean encoding; and how to perform feature crosses.

> Datasets, Generalization, and Overfitting:

An introduction to the characteristics of machine learning datasets, and how to prepare your data to ensure high-quality results when training and evaluating your model.

> Neural Networks:

An introduction to the fundamental principles of neural network architectures, including perceptrons, hidden layers, and activation functions.

> Embeddings:

Learn how embeddings allow you to do machine learning on large feature vectors.

> Large Language Models:

An introduction to large language models, from tokens to Transformers. Learn the basics of how LLMs learn to predict text output, as well as how they're architected and trained.

> Production ML Systems:

Learn how a machine learning production system works across a breadth of components.

> AutoML:

Learn principles and best practices for using automated machine learning.

> ML Fairness:

Learn principles and best practices for auditing ML models for fairness, including strategies for identifying and mitigating biases in data.
