This course crams months of computer science. It covers the exact same computer science content that will help you to ace interviews at huge companies like Google, Tesla, Amazon, and Facebook. It starts with the basics and then eventually covers “advanced topics” like Heaps, Graphs, and Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm. 

### Benefits
