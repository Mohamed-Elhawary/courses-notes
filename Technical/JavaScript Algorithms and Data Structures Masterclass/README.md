This course crams months of computer science. It covers the exact same computer science content that will help you to ace interviews at huge companies like Google, Tesla, Amazon, and Facebook. It starts with the basics and then eventually covers “advanced topics” like Heaps, Graphs, and Dijkstra’s Shortest Path Algorithm. 

## Benefits: 

• A 5-step approach to solving any difficult coding problem.
• 6 different sorting algorithms: Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Quick, Merge, and Radix Sort.   
• Implement our own data structures from scratch, including linked lists, trees, heaps, hash tables, and graphs.
• Analyze the time and space complexity of our code using Big O notation.

• Recursion
• Traverse Trees and Graphs
• Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm  
• Common Programming Patterns 
• Popular Searching Algorithms 
• Dynamic Programming
