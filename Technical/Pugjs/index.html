      this is internal text inside the div and the previous type vertical line is for taking one break line spacing to type the text in its own line

    this is external text outside the div and the previous type line is for taking one break line spacing to type the text in its own line

      this is block of texts inside the parent div, you can here write as you want of texts in multi lines
      as a second option to type a text instead of using the type line sign option, and note that the two previous 
      type lines signs before the block of text sign(.) is for taking one break line spacing to type the block of code 
      starting from its own line not starting beside another element, another note that the first word from each line in the block text
      is visible to us as a new element as it is colored with red color and this is not wrong from you, this is a bug error in the editor itself
      because this word still refers to a text word not to an element in the compilied html page so you are the right one.
    </div>

    <div>this is &lt;strong&gt;buffered code&lt;/strong&gt; escape the tags and any entities signs and show them in the browser in thier original shape, this is like you use entity way in regular html code but it is easier way</div>
    <div>this is <strong>unescaped buffered code</strong> not escape the tags and any entities signs and show them in browser as you write regular html code (regular way) , prefered to not use this way and write the code in the normal way as any element in this page</div>
